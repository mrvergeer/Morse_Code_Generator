This code is part of the Udemy course "100 Days of Code" and covers Day 82.

**Goal**
This project, the aim is for a user to provide an AlphaNumeric input, 
and for the tool to translate this into Morse Code. 

**What the Tool does**
The tool asks for user input. It then verifies if the input consists only of letters and numbers. 
Provided input is converted to a Morse list, where each letter is replaced by it's corresponding Morse
Code. The link between letter and related Morse code comes from a separate CSV file. 

The user will receive the Morse code in writing (e.g. "..--") and will hear it as a sound as well. 

After the translation, and the sound has been played, the user will be asked if there are additional words
they would like to translate. If "Y", the code restarts. If anything else, the code stops.
